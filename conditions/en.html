<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following access terms are read, understood and accepted by all Familine users, since they submit their account request, and until their access is revoked (such as when they don't respect these access terms).</p>
<p>These conditions only apply to the version of Familine as hosted by Equestria.dev (familine.minteck.org). Familine is free, libre and open-source software that anyone can host and use without restrictions, for free, on their own terms, in their own family and with their own content and changes.</p>

<h2>Access time</h2>
<p>Your access to Familine is given right after your account is activated by an administrator. Some services may need up to 3 working days until you get read-write access; but read-only access is given immediately.</p>
<p>Familine can, at any time, without any valid reason, temporarily or permanently suspend your access to Familine, potentially deleting all user data across the different services, permanently. Furthermore, Familine can engage legal procedures if you don't respect applicable French laws.</p>

<h2>Familine and children (less than 16 years old)</h2>
<p>Legal age to use the Internet without supervision in France is 15. After this age, a child becomes responsible of their personal data online. With that said, without parental consent, a children who is less than 15 is not allowed to use their own Familine account. Familine does not consider the legal age in your living country, even if it is higher than 15.</p>
<p>Dans l'éventualité où Familine soupsconerait un utilisateur d'avoir moins de 15 ans et de ne pas disposer d'autorisation parentale, son compte pourrait être suspendu de façon permanente.</p>

<h2>Position inside of the family</h2>
<p>Familine is directed towards users who are legally use commonly close to the administrators of the Equestria.dev infrastructure, which may include friends and members of far and non-biological family. If no member of the family directed you to Familine, you may not be allowed to access it (however, you may still try).</p>
<p>To verify your identity, Familine may require you to send in a copy of a document that can prove your identity. It is not recommended to send an ID card, you should rather send a drivers license, healthcare card, voter card, family book or credit card (don't forget to hide the numbers). Sending fake or modified documents will lead to legal procedures.</p>

<h2>Additional subscriptions</h2>
<p>Familine may, throughout its services, sell you additional paid services that can add features to the platform or give you access to exclusive additional content.</p>
<p>Minors (person who are less than 18 years old) are unable to purchase a subscription without parental consent. Furthermore, payment can only be done physically for personal reasons; it will, in the future, be possible to pay directly from Familine.</p>

<h2>Potential issues</h2>
<p>Due to their complexity, Familine cannot guarantee perfect good operation of its services. However, it is recommended that you send us any potential issue by email at support@familine.minteck.org.</p>
